### ⌁ What you can do with Joinchat (formerly WAme) ✅

#### 🛎 Insert a contact button for WhatsApp on your website.
Set your ‘WhatsApp’ or ‘WhatsApp Business’ number and let your visitors contact you easily:

🧩 **WhatsApp Contact Button Block** with optional QR Code

📱 On mobile, launch WhatsApp mobile app

💻 On desktop, launch WhatsApp desktop app or WhatsApp Web

🤳 On desktop, **show QR Code** to scan from phone

Customize your logo, profile picture or even an animated gif.

Define in which pages or zones it should appear, the delay time, if you want it to the right or to the left, only on mobile phones or also on the desktop.

You can define a tooltip or a call to action to capture the user's interest, the limit is set by your creativity.

#### 📢 New on Joinchat 5

* **Onboarding:** Set up Joinchat from a chat.
* **Preview:** Visualize the appearance of Joinchat before publishing it.
* **Custom CSS:** Add your custom CSS from the plugin's own settings and only load when needed.
* **Multi-language:** Better access to manage translations.

#### 📝 Settings at page or archive level.
You can **change main settings on every Post, Page, Product or CPT and for Tag or Category archive pages**.

Editing your posts in the right side in the Joinchat metabox or editing your tags or categories in the Joinchat section, you can modify Phone, CTA, Start Message and Visibility options.

#### 🔴 Show a notification.
Use a balloon on the button to get the visitor's attention.

In this way, you ensure that you do not miss any important message you want to give them, surprise them in a less intrusive way.

#### 📯 Create call-to-action messages.
To get users to start the chat, use custom CTAs on each page, product or section.

Set the first message so that the visitor can start the conversation immediately.

Use our "Dynamic Variables" and you will know what page the visitor is coming from or what product they are looking at when they start the chat.

#### ✅ Opt-in text.
Opt-in is a users' consent to receive messages from a business.

Write a text with the conditions under which the visitor contacts you (or other info that you consider important).

You can make it mandatory and disable contact until the user accepts it.

#### 🛒 Integration with WooCommerce.
Define CTAs and Custom Start Messages for shop page, product pages and for products on sale.

Add beautiful and customizable WhatsApp contact buttons in the Block Editor.

Ready to use patterns with different styles are also included.

Enable QR Code on desktop to allow your visitors to scan it and start messaging from their phone.

You can define phone and initial message of the button or use the post/general Joinchat settings (ideal for Reusable Blocks).

#### 🃏 Dynamic Variables.
Use variables in your CTAs and Start Messages that change dynamically for each page:

**{SITE}** ➡ Website title
**{TITLE}** ➡ Current page title
**{URL}** ➡ Current page url
**{HREF}** ➡ Current page url (full with query params)

== Installation ==

1. Upload the entire `creame-whatsapp-me` folder to the `/wp-content/plugins/` directory.
2. Activate the plugin through the 'Plugins' menu in WordPress.


== Frequently Asked Questions ==

= I can't see the button or it's over / under another thing =

You can change the position of the button so that nothing covers it by adding this CSS in *Appearance > Customize > Custom CSS*:

`.joinchat { z-index:999999; }`

Higher values of z-index are above, the default value is 9000.

If you need to move up:

`/* always */
.joinchat { --bottom: 60px; }

/* mobile only */
@media (max-width: 480px), (orientation: landscape) and (max-height: 480px) {
  .joinchat { --bottom: 60px; }
}`

= Change button size =

You can change the button size by adding this CSS in *Appearance > Customize > Custom CSS*:

`/* always */
.joinchat { --s: 50px; }

/* mobile only */
@media (max-width: 480px), (orientation: landscape) and (max-height: 480px) {
  .joinchat { --s: 40px; }
}`

For WooCommerce Product Button you can change size with:

`.joinchat__woo-btn { --s: 50px; }`


= Shortcodes / Triggers =

Joinchat does not provide any shortcodes, but you can easily link to WhatsApp in two ways:

1. Add an anchor link to `#whatsapp` (open WhastApp directly) or `#joinchat` (show chat window).<br>e.g.: add in your menu a custom link with the URL `#whatsapp`
2. Add a css class to any element, `joinchat_app` (open WhastApp directly) or `joinchat_open` (show chat window).<br>e.g.: `<img src="contact.jpg" class="joinchat_open" alt="Contact">`

This works with your phone settings and message with dynamic variables, **even on pages without Joinchat visible**.

For custom direct WhatsApp links you can add `data-phone` and `data-message` attributes.<br>e.g.: `<a href="#whatsapp" data-phone="99999999" data-message="I want to chat">Chat now!</a>`

= Disable enhanced telephone input =

Joinchat uses International Telephone Input library to facilitate and validate the introduction of the phone number in the format of each country. If you have problems with your phone number or you want to write it directly without any changes you can disable it with this filter *(remember follow [WhatsApp guidelines](https://faq.whatsapp.com/general/contacts/how-to-add-an-international-phone-number))*:

`add_filter( 'joinchat_enhanced_phone', '__return_false' );`

= Allow other roles to change settings =

By default Joinchat settings can only be edited by users with `manage_options` capability (administrator).
You can change the required capability with the filter `"joinchat_capability"`.

`// e.g. allow shop managers:
add_filter( 'joinchat_capability', function(){ return 'manage_woocommerce'; } );

// e.g. allow editors:
add_filter( 'joinchat_capability', function(){ return 'edit_pages'; } );`

Since v4.4 Joinchat menu is placed as direct menu in your wp-admin but you can change it with the filter `"joinchat_submenu"`:

`// Show as submenu under Settings (also require "manage_options" capability)
add_filter( 'joinchat_submenu', '__return_true' );`

= Disable Gutenberg sidebar =

The block editor evolves quickly and errors can occur that we have not anticipated.

If you have any errors with Gutenberg and Joinchat or simply prefer the old Joinchat metabox you can use this filter:

`add_filter( 'joinchat_gutenberg_sidebar', '__return_false' );`

= WPML/Polylang translations =

Joinchat settings are saved in your site's main language. For other languages translation go to *WPML/Polylang Settings > String translations*, filter strings group by "Joinchat" and update the strings for each language.

= Google Analytics integration =

Joinchat sends a custom event when user launch WhatsApp.

If Google Analytics 4 (gtag.js) is detected, use the recommended `'generate_lead'` event:

`gtag('event', 'generate_lead', {
    event_category: 'JoinChat',
    event_action: 'whatsapp: 99999999999',
    event_label: destination_url,
    chat_channel: 'whatsapp',
    chat_id: '99999999999',
    is_mobile: 'yes' | 'no',
});`

If Universal Analtics (analytics.js) is detected:

`ga('send', 'event', 'JoinChat', 'whatsapp: 99999999999', destination_url);`

If your site don't have standard names for UA tracker ('ga') or data layer ('dataLayer') you can set your custom names with this PHP filter. Also can set a different event name for GA4:

`add_filter( 'joinchat_get_settings', function( $settings ){
    $settings['ga_tracker'] = 'gaCustom';
    $settings['ga_event'] = 'myGA4Event';
    $settings['data_layer'] = 'dataLayerCustom';
    return $settings;
} );`

Joinchat is compatible with plugins **MonsterInsights – Google Analytics Dashboard for WordPress** and **Google Tag Manager for WordPress** custom names.

= Google Tag Manager integration =

Joinchat sends a `'JoinChat'` event if GTM is detected when user launch WhatsApp:

`dataLayer.push({
    event: 'JoinChat',
    event_action: 'whatsapp: 99999999999',
    event_label: destination_url,
    chat_channel: 'whatsapp',
    chat_id: '99999999999',
    is_mobile: 'yes' | 'no',
    page_location: current_url,
    page_title: page_title,
});`

= Facebook Pixel integration =

Joinchat sends a `'JoinChat'` custom event if Facebook Pixel is detected when user launch WhatsApp:

`fbq('trackCustom', 'JoinChat', {
    event_action: 'whatsapp: 99999999999',
    event_label: destination_url,
    chat_channel: 'whatsapp',
    chat_id: '99999999999',
    is_mobile: 'yes' | 'no',
    page_location: current_url,
    page_title: page_title,
});`

= Custom Events / add Event Parameters =

Joinchat triggers custom events before launch WhatsApp `'joinchat:open'` and before send analytics events `'joinchat:event'`.

You can use them to extend them to your needs, add extra functions, cancel events or add extra parameters.

`// e.g.: Send webhook to Zapier
jQuery(document).on('joinchat:event', function (event, params) {
  jQuery.post('https://hooks.zapier.com/hooks/catch/123456/xxxxxx/', params );
});

// e.g.: Add user_is_logged param for GA4/GTM event
jQuery(document).on('joinchat:event', function (event, params) {
  params.user_is_logged = document.body.classList.contains('logged-in') ? 'yes' : 'no';
});`

= What about GDPR? =

Joinchat don't use cookies and don't collect personal data.

Joinchat save two localStorage variables for proper operation:

* `joinchat_views` is a visits counter to control when to show chat window.
* `joinchat_hashes` if you set a Call To Action (CTA), when user launch WhatsApp or close Chat Window the CTA hashed is saved to prevent show automatically that CTA again.
