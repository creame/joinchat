== Frequently Asked Questions ==

= Upgrade from WAme to Join.chat =

From version 4.0 we change our name to Join.chat.
To avoid using several prefixes from old and new versions we have decided to rename all them to the new `joinchat`.

* All analytics events change from `WhatsAppMe` to `JoinChat`
* All css styles change from `wame` or `whatsappme` to `joinchat`.
* All actions and filters change from `wame_` or `whatsappme_` to `joinchat_`.

= I can't see the button or it's over / under another thing =

You can change the position of the button so that nothing covers it by adding this CSS in *Appearance > Customize > Custom CSS*:

`.joinchat { z-index:9999; }`

Higher values of z-index are above, the default value is 1000.

If you need to move up:

`/* always */
.joinchat { --bottom: 60px; }

/* mobile only */
@media (max-width: 480px), (max-width: 767px) and (orientation: landscape) {
  .joinchat { --bottom: 60px; }
}`

= Shortcodes / Triggers =

Join.chat does not provide any shortcodes, but you can easily link to WhatsApp in two ways:

1. Add an anchor link to `#whatsapp` (open WhastApp directly) or `#joinchat` (show chat window).
e.g.: add in your menu a custom link with the URL `#whatsapp`
2. Add a css class to any element, `joinchat_app` (open WhastApp directly) or `joinchat_open` (show chat window).
e.g.: `<img src="contact.jpg" class="joinchat_open" alt="Contact">`

This works with your phone settings and message with dynamic variables, **even on pages without Join.chat visible**.

For custom WhatsApp links, you can create the url with our **[WhatsApp link generator](https://join.chat/en/whatsapp-link/) free tool** and copy it to your links.

= Disable enhanced telephone input =

Join.chat uses International Telephone Input library to facilitate and validate the introduction of the phone number in the format of each country. If you have problems with your phone number or you want to write it directly without any changes you can disable it with this filter *(remember follow [WhatsApp guidelines](https://faq.whatsapp.com/general/contacts/how-to-add-an-international-phone-number))*:

`add_filter( 'joinchat_enhanced_phone', '__return_false' );`

= Allow other roles to change settings =

By default Join.chat settings is a submenu under "Settings" and can only be edited by users with `administrator` role.
You can change the required capability to edit Join.chat general settings with the filter `joinchat_capability`.

e.g. allow shop managers:

`add_filter( 'joinchat_capability', function(){ return 'manage_woocommerce'; } );`

e.g. allow editors:

`add_filter( 'joinchat_capability', function(){ return 'edit_pages'; } );`

When change `joinchat_capability` Join.chat menu will be placed as direct menu in your wp-admin but also you can force it with the filter `joinchat_submenu`:

e.g. force as menu:

`add_filter( 'joinchat_submenu', '__return_false' );`

e.g. force as submenu:

`add_filter( 'joinchat_submenu', '__return_true' );`

= WPML/Polylang translations =

Join.chat settings are saved in your site's main language. For other languages translation go to *WPML/Polylang Settings > String translations*, filter strings group by "Join.chat" and update the strings for each language.

= Google Analytics integration =

Join.chat send a custom event when user click to launch WhatsApp.

If Global Site Tag (gtag.js) detected:

`gtag('event', 'click', { 'event_category': 'JoinChat', 'event_label': out_url })`

If Universal Analtics (analytics.js) detected:

`ga('send', 'event', 'JoinChat', 'click', out_url })`

If your site don't have standard names for UA tracker ('ga') or data layer ('dataLayer') you can set your custom names with this filter:

`add_filter( 'joinchat_get_settings', function( $settings ){
    $settings['ga_tracker'] = 'gaCustom';
    $settings['data_layer'] = 'dataLayerCustom';
    return $settings;
} );`

= Google Tag Manager integration =

Join.chat send an event (if GTM detected) when user click to launch WhatsApp:

`dataLayer.push({ 'event': 'JoinChat', 'eventAction': 'click', 'eventLabel': out_url });`

= Facebook Pixel integration =

Join.chat send a custom event if Facebook Pixel is detected when user click to launch WhatsApp:

`fbq('trackCustom', 'JoinChat', { eventAction: 'click', eventLabel: out_url });`

= Other integrations =

There is a Javascript event that Join.chat triggers automatically before launch WhatsApp, which can be used to add your custom tracking code (or other needs).

`jQuery(function($){
  $(document).on('joinchat:open', function (event, args, settings) {
    // Your staff
    // Note: args.link is the link to open, you can change it
    // but only wa.me, whastapp.com or current domain are allowed.

    // e.g.: Google Ads conversion
    gtag_report_conversion();
  });
});`

= What about GDPR? =

Join.chat don't use cookies.

Join.chat save two localStorage variables for proper operation:

* `joinchat_views` is a visits counter to control when to show chat window.
* `joinchat_hashes` if you set a Call To Action (CTA), when user launch WhatsApp or close Chat Window the CTA hashed is saved to prevent show automatically that CTA again.
