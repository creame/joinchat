### The perfect plugin to engage and retain customers.

#### Communication with your customers can be very easy

With **WhatsApp me** you will get the visitors of your website to contact you through WhatsApp with a single click.

#### Why WhatsApp?
WhatsApp is used in more than 100 countries and supports more than 50 languages. Recent surveys say that 96% of users prefer to use a *messaging app* before calling by phone. If none of this has convinced you, think one thing, your grandmother knows how to use WhatsApp. Do not lose more customers and sales. Try **WhatsApp me**.
