== Frequently Asked Questions ==

= WAme now is Join.chat =

From version 4.0 we change our name to Join.chat.
To avoid using several prefixes from old and new versions we have decided to rename all them to the new `joinchat`.

* All analytics events change from `WhatsAppMe` to `JoinChat`
* All css styles change from `wame` or `whatsappme` to `joinchat`.
* All actions and filters change from `wame_` or `whatsappme_` to `joinchat_`.

= I can't see the button or it's over / under another thing =

You can change the position of the button so that nothing covers it by adding this CSS in *Appearance > Customize > Custom CSS*:

`.joinchat { z-index:9999; }`

Higher values ​​of z-index are above, the default value is 1000.

If you need to move up:

`/* always */
.joinchat { --bottom: 60px; }

/* mobile only */
@media (max-width: 480px), (max-width: 767px) and (orientation: landscape) {
  .joinchat { --bottom: 60px; }
}`

= What about GDPR? =

Join.chat don't use cookies.

Join.chat save two localStorage variables for proper operation:

* `joinchat_visited` to know if is the first time on site or is a returning user.
* `joinchat_hashes` if you set a Call To Action (CTA), when user launch WhatsApp or close Chat Window the CTA hashed is saved to prevent show automatically that CTA again.

= Google Analytics integration =

Join.chat send a custom event when user click to launch WhatsApp.

If Global Site Tag (gtag.js) detected:

`gtag('event', 'click', { 'event_category': 'JoinChat', 'event_label': out_url })`

If Universal Analtics (analytics.js) detected:

`ga('send', 'event', 'JoinChat', 'click', out_url })`

If your tracker doesn't have the standard name 'ga' you can set your custom name with 'ga_tracker' setting:

`add_filter( 'joinchat_get_settings', function( $settings ){
    $settings['ga_tracker'] = 'my_custom_GA_name';
    return $settings;
} );`

= Google Tag Manager integration =

Join.chat send an event (if GTM detected) when user click to launch WhatsApp:

`dataLayer.push({ 'event': 'JoinChat', 'eventAction': 'click', 'eventLabel': out_url });`

= Facebook Pixel integration =

Join.chat send a custom event if Facebook Pixel is detected when user click to launch WhatsApp:

`fbq('trackCustom', 'JoinChat', { eventAction: 'click', eventLabel: out_url });`

= Other integrations =

There is a Javascript event that Join.chat triggers automatically before launch WhatsApp, which can be used to add your custom tracking code (or other needs).

`jQuery(document).ready(function($){
  $(document).on('joinchat:open', function (event, args, settings) {
    // Your staff
    // Note: args.link is the link to open, you can change it
    // but only wa.me, whastapp.com or current domain are allowed.
  });
});`

= WPML/Polylang change Telephone by language =

Join.chat general text settings can be translated with the strings translation of WPML/Polylang. You only need to save Join.chat settings to register strings and make them ready for translation. But "Telephone" is not translateable by default. If you need different phone numbers for every language add the following php code in your theme functions.php and save Join.chat settings.

`add_filter( 'joinchat_settings_i18n', function( $settings ) {
    $settings['telephone'] = 'Telephone';
    return $settings;
} );`
