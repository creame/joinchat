== Frequently Asked Questions ==

= Upgrade from WAme to Join.chat =

From version 4.0 we change our name to Join.chat.
To avoid using several prefixes from old and new versions we have decided to rename all them to the new `joinchat`.

* All analytics events change from `WhatsAppMe` to `JoinChat`
* All css styles change from `wame` or `whatsappme` to `joinchat`.
* All actions and filters change from `wame_` or `whatsappme_` to `joinchat_`.

= I can't see the button or it's over / under another thing =

You can change the position of the button so that nothing covers it by adding this CSS in *Appearance > Customize > Custom CSS*:

`.joinchat { z-index:9999; }`

Higher values ​​of z-index are above, the default value is 1000.

If you need to move up:

`/* always */
.joinchat { --bottom: 60px; }

/* mobile only */
@media (max-width: 480px), (max-width: 767px) and (orientation: landscape) {
  .joinchat { --bottom: 60px; }
}`

= Shortcodes / Triggers =

Join.chat does not provide any shortcodes, but you can easily link to WhatsApp in two ways:

1. Add an anchor link to `#whatsapp` (open WhastApp directly) or `#joinchat` (show chat window).
e.g.: add in your menu a custom link with the URL `#whatsapp`
2. Add a css class to any element, `joinchat_app` (open WhastApp directly) or `joinchat_open` (show chat window).
e.g.: `<img src="contact.jpg" class="joinchat_open" alt="Contact">`

This works with your phone settings and message with dynamic variables, **even on pages without Join.chat visible**.

For custom WhatsApp links, you can create the url with our **[WhatsApp link generator](https://join.chat/en/whatsapp-link/) free tool** and copy it to your links.

= What about GDPR? =

Join.chat don't use cookies.

Join.chat save two localStorage variables for proper operation:

* `joinchat_views` is a visits counter to control when to show chat window.
* `joinchat_hashes` if you set a Call To Action (CTA), when user launch WhatsApp or close Chat Window the CTA hashed is saved to prevent show automatically that CTA again.

= WPML/Polylang translations =

Join.chat settings are saved in your site's main language. For other languages translation go to *WPML/Polylang Settings > String translations*, filter strings group by "Join.chat" and update the strings for each language.

= Google Analytics integration =

Join.chat send a custom event when user click to launch WhatsApp.

If Global Site Tag (gtag.js) detected:

`gtag('event', 'click', { 'event_category': 'JoinChat', 'event_label': out_url })`

If Universal Analtics (analytics.js) detected:

`ga('send', 'event', 'JoinChat', 'click', out_url })`

If your site don't have standard names for UA tracker ('ga') or data layer ('dataLayer') you can set your custom names with this filter:

`add_filter( 'joinchat_get_settings', function( $settings ){
    $settings['ga_tracker'] = 'gaCustom';
    $settings['data_layer'] = 'dataLayerCustom';
    return $settings;
} );`

= Google Tag Manager integration =

Join.chat send an event (if GTM detected) when user click to launch WhatsApp:

`dataLayer.push({ 'event': 'JoinChat', 'eventAction': 'click', 'eventLabel': out_url });`

= Facebook Pixel integration =

Join.chat send a custom event if Facebook Pixel is detected when user click to launch WhatsApp:

`fbq('trackCustom', 'JoinChat', { eventAction: 'click', eventLabel: out_url });`

= Other integrations =

There is a Javascript event that Join.chat triggers automatically before launch WhatsApp, which can be used to add your custom tracking code (or other needs).

`jQuery(function($){
  $(document).on('joinchat:open', function (event, args, settings) {
    // Your staff
    // Note: args.link is the link to open, you can change it
    // but only wa.me, whastapp.com or current domain are allowed.

    // e.g.: Google Ads conversion
    gtag_report_conversion();
  });
});`
